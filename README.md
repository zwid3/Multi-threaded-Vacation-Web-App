## Multi-threaded-Vacation-Web-App


## Project Scope
This is a modified web application built with Spring Boot and AngularJS that incorporates multithreaded functionality to display information about the Landon Hotel in Canada.

**My contributions:**
I was responsible for directly implementing the multithreaded components that are essential to the websiteâ€™s functionality.

**This includes:**
```- Updating the front-end logic to display messages in both English and French using multithreading.```
```- Implementing a message executor in Java to retrieve information from Angular components and display it via a Spring Boot controller.```
```- Enhancing the Angular components to perform real-time currency conversion.```
```- Utilizing Java to handle time zone conversions across three different regions.```
```- Creating a Docker image of the entire application.```
